# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

I would say object oriented programming is one of the harder concepts for me to wrap my head around. Especially when it comes to when to use certain things like class variables and getters and setters and what exactly they do. 

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?

I really enjoyed mod 0 and had a lot of fun doing the assignments. I don't have a lot of trouble staying focused.

- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?

I think I need to review OOP again before mod 1, especially the big concepts like polymorphism and inheritance.
